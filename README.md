# SAMIAssignment

Hello! This is where I'm updating changes to the code.
Please, feel free to download it and try and play around with it, or skim through - most of it is just me playing around with the data.

# The Different .ipynb's
`SAMIAssignment.ipynb` is where I will be running the actual code for the assignment.
`Fits.ipynb` is where I read and produce plots of the .fits files. The images can be found in the `/fitsfiles` folder.

# The Different Files
`Query.csv` is the uncleaned data used for the assignment.
`FJR.csv` is the cleaned data used for the assignment.
`FJR_withAGE.csv` is the cleaned data used for the assignment with Galaxy Age and Star Formation Rate Information.

Note: the reason these two .csv's are seperated is because the data is cleaned in seperate ways.

# The Different Folders
`/plots` is where I save all my graphics generated from the `SAMIAssignment.ipynb`.
`/fitsfiles` is where you can find the .fits files and related images.
`/readings` is where you can find and put readings relevent to the assignment.
